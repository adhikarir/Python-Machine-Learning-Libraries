# Python Machine Learning Libraries
This repositories include the basic machine libraries which are useful in the machine learning project.


## Numpy
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely. [Click here for more detail](https://github.com/adhikarir/Python-Machine-Learning-Libraries/blob/master/numpy/NumPy.ipynb)


## Pandas
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

In a nutshell, Pandas is like excel for Python, with tables (which in pandas are called DataFrames), rows and columns (which in pandas are called Series), and many functionalities that make it an awesome library for processing and data inspection and manipulation.

## Seaborn
Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures in Python. Visualization is the central part of Seaborn which helps in exploration and understanding of data.

## MatplotLib
Matplotlib is a library in Python Programming Language, which provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt or GTK+. It was originally written by John D.Hunter. [Click here for more detail](https://github.com/adhikarir/Python-Machine-Learning-Libraries/blob/master/MatplotLib/MatplotLib.ipynb)


## Tensorflow
TensorFlow is a library for number crunching created and maintained by Google. It’s used mainly for machine learning (especially deep learning) tasks. It is a symbolic math library that uses dataflow and differentiable programming to perform various tasks focused on training and inference of deep neural networks. It allows developers to create machine learning applications using various tools, libraries, and community resources. Currently, the most famous deep learning library in the world is Google’s TensorFlow. Google product uses machine learning in all of its products to improve the search engine, translation, image captioning or recommendations.
